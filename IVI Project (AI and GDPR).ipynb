    "This project was for my internship at Innovation Value Institute located at Maynooth University during June-August 2024 during my study abroad program in Dublin, Ireland. I was assigned to extract data from the EU's AI Act and the General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR. I focused on key words such as \"anonymisation\", \"archiving\", \"backup\", \"compliance\", etc to see if there were any overlapping articles between each of the documents. \n",
